# Oshikatsu JSON

A simple, beautiful, and statically-generated web page to display and track your "Oshikatsu" (Êé®„ÅóÊ¥ª) anniversaries. This project reads data directly from a `JSON` file, making it incredibly easy to customize and deploy.

**Live Demo:** oshikatsu.luqmanhadi.com

## ‚ú® Features

-   **JSON-Powered:** All data is managed in a single `public/oshikatsu.json` file. No database needed.
-   **Anniversary Counter:** Automatically calculates and displays the number of days you've been supporting your "oshi".
-   **Statically Generated:** Built with the Next.js App Router for excellent performance and SEO.
-   **Beautifully Styled:** Clean and modern design using Tailwind CSS.
-   **Easily Deployable:** Ready to be deployed on Vercel or any other static hosting provider.

## üîß How to Customize

The core of this application is the `public/oshikatsu.json` file. To add your own "oshi", simply edit this file.

Each entry in the JSON array should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "order_id": 1,
  "oshi_name_en": "Hoshimachi Suisei",
  "oshi_name_jp": "ÊòüË°ó„Åô„ÅÑ„Åõ„ÅÑ",
  "oshi_org_en": "hololive",
  "oshi_org_jp": "„Éõ„É≠„É©„Ç§„Éñ",
  "oshi_mark": "‚òÑÔ∏è",
  "oshi_start_date": "2019-05-19"
}
```

-   `order_id`: A unique number to determine the display order.
-   `oshi_name_en` / `oshi_name_jp`: The name of your oshi in English and Japanese.
-   `oshi_org_en` / `oshi_org_jp`: The organization or group they belong to.
-   `oshi_mark`: An emoji or symbol representing them.
-   `oshi_start_date`: The date you started supporting them, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

After editing the JSON file, the changes will be reflected the next time you build the project.
